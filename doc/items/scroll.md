# Spell Scrolls

Spell scrolls are one-time-use consumables which can be used to cast
slightly more powerful spells than 
[Spellbooks](spellbook.md). 

You can craft them using one paper, one string, and one copper ingot by
default, and they can be written to using the 
[Writing Table](../blocks/writing-desk.md).
