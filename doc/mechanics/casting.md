# Casting

## Spellbook
*See [Spellbook](../items/spellbook.md)* for crafting and item details

Currently, the foremost handheld tool you will use to cast spells is the
**[Spellbook](../items/spellbook.md)**.
Excepting one-off spells and testing, this is generally how most people 
will use magic.

Spellbooks can be written using a 
**[Spellbook and Quill](../items/spellbook-and-quill.md)**,
or converted from a Written Book using a
**[Spellbook Binder](../items/spellbook-binder.md)**,

Spells cast from a spellbook are generally around 70% the cost of the
spell when cast verbally, and will have less adverse effects on the user.
There is a limit to the maximum power of a spell cast through a spellbook,
after which spells will fizzle.

## Scrolls
*See [Scroll](../items/scroll.md)* for crafting and item details

Scrolls are another, slightly less cost-efficient way to cast spells.
They can only be written at a 
**[Writing Desk](../blocks/writing-desk.md)**,
and can only be used once, but can cast slightly more powerful spells.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are incredibly rare and powerful casting implements with no
upper limit on cost, with the caveat that they cannot be created directly.

You can only find them in loot in certain higher level areas, like Ancient
Cities, Bastions, and End Cities.

## Casting Lecterns

Casting Lecterns can be used to cast spells without player input.
You can place a Spellbook on one by right-clicking on the lectern with
a Spellbook in hand, and the lectern will cast in the direction the
back of the lectern is facing. Lecterns can not cast spells upwards or
downwards.

A Casting Lectern's focus can be modified using a
[Casting Crystal](../items/casting-crystal.md).

## Verbal Casting

In addition to casting Spells from a **[Spellbook](../items/spellbook.md)**, you
may also speak a Spell aloud in order to either test it or construct
new Spells on the fly.

Casting Spells yourself does come with some advantages and drawbacks
which Spellbooks don't carry. When casting a Spell, your throat may be
burned by magical residue. For most low-level spells, this won't do much
but prevent you from casting more spells verbally. If constructing spells,
be careful, however, as cast spells may harm or change you in ways a
Spellbook wouldn't.
As spells become more expensive, they will drain your hunger and health,
potentially even leading to death, so be careful!
